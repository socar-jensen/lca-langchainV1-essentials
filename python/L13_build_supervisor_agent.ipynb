    "# Build a supervisor agent\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The **supervisor pattern** is a [multi-agent](/oss/python/langchain/multi-agent) architecture where a central supervisor agent coordinates specialized worker agents. This approach excels when tasks require different types of expertise. Rather than building one agent that manages tool selection across domains, you create focused specialists coordinated by a supervisor who understands the overall workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you'll build a personal assistant system that demonstrates these benefits through a realistic workflow. The system will coordinate two specialists with fundamentally different responsibilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **calendar agent** that handles scheduling, availability checking, and event management.\n",
    "* An **email agent** that manages communication, drafts messages, and sends notifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also incorporate [human-in-the-loop review](/oss/python/langchain/human-in-the-loop) to allow users to approve, edit, and reject actions (such as outbound emails) as desired.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why use a supervisor?\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-agent architectures allow you to partition [tools](/oss/python/langchain/tools) across workers, each with their own individual prompts or instructions. Consider an agent with direct access to all calendar and email APIs: it must choose from many similar tools, understand exact formats for each API, and handle multiple domains simultaneously. If performance degrades, it may be helpful to separate related tools and associated prompts into logical groups (in part to manage iterative improvements).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "We will cover the following concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Multi-agent systems](/oss/python/langchain/multi-agent)\n",

    "## 8. Key takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "The supervisor pattern creates layers of abstraction where each layer has a clear responsibility. When designing a supervisor system, start with clear domain boundaries and give each sub-agent focused tools and prompts. Write clear tool descriptions for the supervisor, test each layer independently before integration, and control information flow based on your specific needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "<Tip>\n",
    "  **When to use the supervisor pattern**\n",
    "\n",
    "  Use the supervisor pattern when you have multiple distinct domains (calendar, email, CRM, database), each domain has multiple tools or complex logic, you want centralized workflow control, and sub-agents don't need to converse directly with users.\n",
    "\n",
    "  For simpler cases with just a few tools, use a single agent. When agents need to have conversations with users, use [handoffs](/oss/python/langchain/multi-agent#handoffs) instead. For peer-to-peer collaboration between agents, consider other multi-agent patterns.\n",
    "</Tip>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Learn about [handoffs](/oss/python/langchain/multi-agent#handoffs) for agent-to-agent conversations, explore [context engineering](/oss/python/langchain/context-engineering) to fine-tune information flow, read the [multi-agent overview](/oss/python/langchain/multi-agent) to compare different patterns, and use [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com) to debug and monitor your multi-agent system.\n",
